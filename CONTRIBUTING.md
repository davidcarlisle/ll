Please note any significant change to the content of questions in
[`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG), including which lesson is changed in the
format `Q-<number>`.

Commit messages where the content of a single lesson is changed should start
with `L-<name>`. Changes to the _content_ of lessons should always be made in
separate commits: formatting, typos or other 'non-significant' changes can be
made for multiple lessons in one go.

If you are making a significant change to the content, please make sure you
add yourself to the [contributors list](AUTHORS.md).

## Formatting

The site is written in [GitHub-flavoured
Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/), and uses the
[GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) system to convert this to web pages.
In general, Markdown is easy to use, and offers enough formatting power to make
the site useful. There are a few things to watch out for

- The Jekyll 'back-end' used by GitHub Pages is somewhat picky about unbalanced
  braces (`{` and `}`), even in code blocks. That's because it is looking for
  some instructions of its own there. To turn this off, surround the relevant
  parts of your source with

  <code>&lt;!-- &#x7b;&#x25; raw &#x25;&#x7d; --&gt;</code>

  and

  <code>&lt;!-- &#x7b;&#x25; endraw &#x25;&#x7d; --&gt;</code>

  (Typically these will go just before and after the
  <code>&#96;&#96;&#96;</code> lines.)

- Only use block quotes for real quotations: use code markup for terminal
  output and similar

- We use the following HTML entities for special characters:
  - `&hellip;` Ellipsis
  - `&mdash;` Em-dash
  - `&ndash;` En-dash
  - `&nbsp;` Non-breaking space

- quotes you can use ASCII double and single quotes, which will be changed
  to typographical quotes: `"abc" 'abc' abc's` produces abc abc abcs.

- Please wrap source lines to keep them below 80 characters long
